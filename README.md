Due to the rapid growth of the
E-Commerce industry in recent years,
extremely large amounts of monetary
losses have resulted from fraudulent credit
card transactions. A robust model that
relies on advanced machine learning
algorithms that can manage large amounts
of data while also providing accurate
results is an efficient way to counter these
fraudulent transactions. This paper
compares the performance of linear
regression, decision tree, and random
forest for detecting credit card fraud. This
model shows promising results and its AUC
is 0.972 .
